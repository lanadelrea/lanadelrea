Hello world! :wave: My friends call me Adel, Ade, or Adie. I love learning new things.

My current interests are:
- Developing nextflow pipelines to streamline bioinformatics analysis.
- Analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from biosurveillance.
- Metagenomics Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) of bacterial populations.
- Making soup recipes. My favorite soup is a simple egg drop soup.
